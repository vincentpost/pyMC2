The well class should have the following properties: x and y coordinates, an extraction rate and a casing radius. Also define a class for a well field, which can contain multiple wells. Define a __str__ method for both classes that produces an informative string about the class properties. Check if your code runs properly by creating instances of your classes.\n",
    "Note, you do not have to go with the well and well field classes: You can also come up with an idea of your own. For example, a collection of locks and weirs in a river, or streams within a catchment. Anything goes, the main aim is to practice the definition of classes."
