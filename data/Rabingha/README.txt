No simultaneous manual readings to correct the position of the datalogger (we rely on the measured cable length).

On 23.09.2021 09:00, the measurement (atmospheric pressure) indicates that the datalogger was taken out for a short period (only one measurement affected).
It was replaced 1 m higher than its original position.

The borehole is pumped almost daily from 5-6 am to 7 pm. 
It mostly recovers during the night from the daily drawdown.
