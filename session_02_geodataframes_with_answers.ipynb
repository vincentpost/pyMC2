    "## Downloading data from a REST API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next exercise we will pull online data into a Pandas DataFrame. We'll make use of the documentation of a library was developed by Kent Inverarity for obtaining groundwater data from the South Australian WaterConnect database, see\n",
    "<A href=\"https://github.com/kinverarity1/python-sa-gwdata\">https://github.com/kinverarity1/python-sa-gwdata</A>. The key command behind both libraries is the `get` method of the `requests` package, which will attempt to retrieve data from a specified source. The request is made by passing an url with a specifc stucture, which is defined by the application programming interface (API) of the service that is being queried. Several protocols exists, with the most common one today being the representational state transfer architectural style (REST), and an API that conforms to this standard is called a RESTful API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without providing any more technical details, let's just try to see how this works. Click the following link and observe the information that appears in your web browser.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data obtained appear in the form of a table and it can be seen that there are several fields. This is not very useful yet, but it gives you an idea of the information that is sent when you use the `get` method. If you look at the above url, it is possible to recognise three parts:\n",

    " * a command: 'GetObswellNumberSearchData'\n",
    " * a section with parameters for the command: 'OBSNUMBER=WLG051'\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's do this in Python using the `get` method. We create a variable `url`, which combines the base url and the command and we pass the command parameters as a dictionary."
