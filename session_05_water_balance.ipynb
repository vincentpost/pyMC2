    "The code cells below make use of the classes Tracer, Isotope and MassBalance, which are defined the Python files tracers.py and mass_balance.py. The definition of these clasess give you and idea on how to structure a model code based on the principles of object-oriented programming. It takes quite a bit of time to design the structure of the class and think about the best way to organise things, but once you have it, all it takes is a few lines to run the model and plot the results for the various tracers. No need to repeat code that is 95% the same over and over again for various tracers."
